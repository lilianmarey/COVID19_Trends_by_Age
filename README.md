# COVID19: Trends by Age

Dash-based app

app.py can be run from terminal : it launches the application using the CSV file /data/data_preprocessed.py

Last processed data dates 2020/11/10

Ask me if you want me to process more recent data !

However you can also process it by yourself :

    * Download Output_10.csv from https://osf.io/mpwjq/
    * Run data_preprocessing.py from cmd (creates data/data_preprocessed_test.py)

Data visualisation project on Covid-19 cases, deaths by age bands

Main data source : https://osf.io/mpwjq/
